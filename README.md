# Week 1 Code Refactor Challenge
Week one code refactor challenge focusing on all skill learnt through week including accessibility and semantics.


## Description
The coding behind the Horiseon webpage needed updating with accessibility in mind. Semantic elements were covered as well fixing broken links and consolidating bulky code. The code was also formatted so that it was easier to read with notes throughout.

## Refactor Process

* Added web page title.

* Refactored select div elements to semantic HTML elements.

* Re-identified selectors in CSS file accordingly.

* Fixed broken navigational link.

* Added alt attributes to images to improve SEO.

* Consolidated repetitive factors in CSS file.

* Removed unnecessary class attributes.

* Added comments to index.html and style.css to help outline the process

* Followed scout rules and left code a little cleaner than when I found it.

## Additional ideas

* Could have adjusted to cover overflow of text as well as use containers / flex for layout but this goes beyond the requirements of the MVP and tasks in the README file.
